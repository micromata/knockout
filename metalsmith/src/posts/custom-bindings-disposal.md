In a typical Knockout application, DOM elements are dynamically added and removed, for example using the [`template`](template-binding.html) binding or via control-flow bindings ([`if`](if-binding.html), [`ifnot`](ifnot-binding.html), [`with`](with-binding.html), and [`foreach`](foreach-binding.html)). When creating a custom binding, it is often desirable to add clean-up logic that runs when an element associated with your custom binding is removed by Knockout.

### Registering a callback on the disposal of an element

To register a function to run when a node is removed, you can call `ko.utils.domNodeDisposal.addDisposeCallback(node, callback)`. As an example, suppose you create a custom binding to instantiate a widget. When the element with the binding is removed, you may want to call the `destroy` method of the widget:

```javascript
ko.bindingHandlers.myWidget = {
    init: function(element, valueAccessor) {
        var options = ko.unwrap(valueAccessor()),
            $el = $(element);

        $el.myWidget(options);

        ko.utils.domNodeDisposal.addDisposeCallback(element, function() {
            // This will be called when the element is removed by Knockout or
            // if some other part of your code calls ko.removeNode(element)
            $el.myWidget("destroy");
        });
    }
};
```

### Overriding the clean-up of external data

When removing an element, Knockout runs logic to clean up any data associated with the element. As part of this logic, Knockout calls jQuery's `cleanData` method if jQuery is loaded in your page. In advanced scenarios, you may want to prevent or customize how this data is removed in your application. Knockout exposes a function, `ko.utils.domNodeDisposal.cleanExternalData(node)`, that can be overridden to support custom logic. For example, to prevent `cleanData` from being called, an empty function could be used to replace the standard `cleanExternalData` implementation:

```javascript
ko.utils.domNodeDisposal.cleanExternalData = function () {
    // Do nothing. Now any jQuery data associated with elements will
    // not be cleaned up when the elements are removed from the DOM.
};
```
