Simply reference the JavaScript file using a `<script>` tag somewhere on your HTML pages. For example,

```html
<script type='text/javascript' src='knockout-3.1.0.js'></script>
```

Change the `src` attribute to match the location where you put
the download file, or use one of the Content Delivery Networks at
the footer of this page.

You can also get Knockout over *bower*:

> $ bower install knockoutjs

and *npm*:

> $ npm install knockout

Next, if you are new to Knockout, you can get started with
[interactive tutorials](http://learn.knockoutjs.com), or explore
 the [documentation](#docs).
