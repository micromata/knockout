<p>Knockout is tested on the following browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox (versions 2 - latest)</li>
<li>Google Chrome (versions 5 - latest)</li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (versions 6 - 11)</li>
<li>Apple Safari (tested on Windows Safari version 5, Mac OS X Safari version 3.1.2, and iPhone Safari for iOS 4-7; should work on newer/older versions too)</li>
<li>Opera (versions 10 - recent)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s very likely that Knockout also works on older and newer versions of these browsers, but there&#39;s only so many combinations we can check regularly! At the time of the last check, Knockout was also found to work on the following browsers (though we don&#39;t recheck these for every release):</p>
<ul>
<li>Opera Mini</li>
<li>Google Android OS browser</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a good idea of how Knockout will run on another browser or platform, simply <a href="../spec/runner.html">run the test suite</a>. This will validate hundreds of behavioral specifications and produce a report of any problems. The pass rate should be 100% on all the browsers listed above.</p>
