<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The <code>submit</code> binding adds an event handler so that your chosen JavaScript function will be invoked when the associated DOM element is submitted. Typically you will only want to use this on <code>form</code> elements.</p>
<p>When you use the <code>submit</code> binding on a form, Knockout will prevent the browser&#39;s default submit action for that form. In other words, the browser will call your handler function but will <em>not</em> submit the form to the server. This is a useful default because when you use the <code>submit</code> binding, it&#39;s normally because you&#39;re using the form as an interface to your view model, not as a regular HTML form. If you <em>do</em> want to let the form submit like a normal HTML form, just return <code>true</code> from your <code>submit</code> handler.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-example">html: |-
  &lt;form data-bind=&quot;submit: doSomething&quot;&gt;
      ... form contents go here ...
      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
javascript: |-
  var viewModel = {
      doSomething : function(formElement) {
          // ... now do something
      }
  };
</code></pre>
<p>As illustrated in this example, KO passes the form element as a parameter to your submit handler function. You can ignore that parameter if you want, or there are various ways you might want to use it, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extracting additional data or state from the form elements</p>
</li>
<li><p>Triggering UI-level validation using a library such as <a href="https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation">jQuery Validation</a>, using code similar to the following snippet: <code>if ($(formElement).valid()) { /* do something */ }</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-not-just-put-a-click-handler-on-the-submit-button-">Why not just put a <code>click</code> handler on the submit button?</h3>
<p>Instead of using <code>submit</code> on the form, you <em>could</em> use <code>click</code> on the submit button. However, <code>submit</code> has the advantage that it also captures alternative ways to submit the form, such as pressing the <em>enter</em> key while typing into a text box.</p>
<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Main parameter</p>
<p>The function you want to bind to the element&#39;s <code>submit</code> event.</p>
<p>You can reference any JavaScript function - it doesn&#39;t have to be a function on your view model. You can reference a function on any object by writing <code>submit: someObject.someFunction</code>.</p>
<p>Functions on your view model are slightly special because you can reference them by name, i.e., you can write <code>submit: doSomething</code> and <em>don&#39;t</em> have to write <code>submit: viewModel.doSomething</code> (though technically that&#39;s also valid).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>For information about how to pass additional parameters to your submit handler function, or how to control the <code>this</code> handle when invoking functions that aren&#39;t on your view model, see the notes relating to the <a href="/a/click-binding.html">click binding</a>. All the notes on that page apply to <code>submit</code> handlers too.</p>
